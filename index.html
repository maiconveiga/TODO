Introduction
This document contains a high-level overview of the Performance Verification Tool (PVT) and detailed quick reference information
for field personnel.
You can use PVT in the following modes:
Autoscan mode
Autoscan mode is setup on a customer's Metasys Server machine. Configure PVT to automatically run scheduled scans. Unless
the site uses a Split Server configuration, then PVT is configured for Autoscan on the SCT machine. PVT syncs the scan data to
the cloud. The scan data is available in the PVT dashboard. You can also download reports from the cloud dashboard. The data
that is retrieved from a PVT scan is used by OpenBlue Remote Diagnostics and Reporting (OB-RDR) deployments. If you install
PVT as part of a OpenBlue Remote Diagnostics and Reporting (OB-RDR) deployment, you must configure PVT in Autoscan
mode.
Interactive mode
Interactive mode is used by Johnson Controls technicians and is set up on Johnson Controls machines with a Technician
license. You can create scans, generate reports, save a scan in a PVT file, and view and export scan data on an as-needed basis.
Depending on your license, PVT starts in either Autoscan mode or interactive mode. See Licensing PVT.
Use PVT for the following tasks:
Scan supervisory devices and apply inventory and performance rules based on site preferences to raise awareness to potential
issues.
Identify the equipment and system controls.
Determine the overall health of the Metasys system. See Table 1.
Generate reports from the PVT Client or Cloud Dashboard.
For more information about generating reports in interactive mode in the PVT Client, refer to Generating reports.
For information about generating reports in the Cloud Dashboard, refer to Generating reports from the Metasys PVT
Cloud Dashboard.
PVT is supported in Metasys releases that include the following component versions:
Engine Site Director: 8.0 or later
ADS/ADX: 6.5 or later. Auto upload and dbexport requires 9.0.
Open Application Server (OAS)
Child engines: 5.0 or later

Performance data
The following information is gathered during a performance scan:
Table 1. Performance Analysis Tab
Type of analysis Description
Performance and Savings
Scheduling If the Occupancy Command object has a value in its priority array between priorities 1 to 15, the
device is considered Scheduled. If no values exist in the priority array between priorities 1 to 15, the
device is considered Unscheduled. If the Occupancy Command object cannot be found based on the
search criteria the device is categorized as Undetermined. You can configure the search criteria using
the options under the Preference menu.
Economizer For Air Handling Units (AHUs): if the Economizer Status object value is True when the Outdoor Air
Temperature object value is less than the Discharge Air Temperature Set Point object value during a
trended 24-hour period, then the equipment is categorized as AHUs With Economizer. If the
Economizer Status object value is not True when the Outdoor Air Temperature object value is less
than the Discharge Air Temperature Set Point object value during a trended 24-hour period, the
equipment is categorized as AHUs Without Economizer. If none of the required objects are found
based on the search criteria or they do not have trends, the equipment rule is categorized as
Undetermined. You can configure the search criteria using the options under the Preference menu.
Fan Motors For AHUs: if the Supply Fan Output object always shows a value of 100% for a trended 24-hour
period, then the equipment is categorized as Fans always running 100% and shows the message
Note:
Page 28 of 33
Type of analysis Description
Point name is running on maximum speed. If the Supply Fan Output object is not found
based on the search criteria the equipment is categorized as Undetermined. You can configure the
search criteria using the options under the Preference menu.
AHU Reset Strategy If the Discharge Air Temperature Setpoint or the Duct Static Pressure Setpoint does not change
within a 24-hour period, then it is assumed that no reset strategy is implemented and the device is
flagged. If neither point can be found, then the device is marked as Undetermined.
100% Outdoor Air Handling
Unit
For AHUs: if the Mixed Air Damper and Mixed Air Temperature objects are found, or the Outdoor Air
Damper object value shows variable modulation between 0% and 100%, then the device is
categorized as AHU Without 100% Outdoor Air. If neither Mixed Air objects are found and the
Outdoor Air Damper object value shows 2-stage operation (0% or 100%), then the device is
categorized as AHU With 100% Outdoor Air. If none of the objects identified above are found based
on the search criteria the device is categorized as Undetermined. You can configure the search
criteria using the options under the Preference menu.
Heating or Cooling Waste For AHUs: if the Heating Output object value is greater than 0% when the Outdoor Air Temperature
object value is above 80°F within a trended 24-hour period, then the equipment produces Heating
Waste. If the Cooling Output object value is greater than 0% when the Outdoor Air Temperature
object value is below 60° F within a trended 24-hour period, then the equipment produces Cooling
Waste. If none of the objects or trends identified above could be found based on the search criteria
the equipment is considered Undetermined. You can configure the search criteria using the options
under the Preference menu.
Maintenance and Reliability
Dirty Filter For AHUs: if the pressure drop across the filter triggers the differential pressure switch or the
Differential Pressure Sensor object value shows a pressure drop greater than 0.5 in. W.C., the
equipment is considered to have a dirty filter. If the pressure drop across the filter does not trigger
the differential pressure switch and the Differential Pressure Sensor object value shows a pressure
drop less than 0.5 in. W.C., no notification is generated. If neither of the identified objects that
represent the filter pressure switch or the filter pressure sensor are found during the performance
scan, the equipment rule is categorized as Undetermined. You can configure the search criteria using
the options under the Preference menu.
Unbound References Identifies the unbound references by supervisory device. To view unbound references in the Power BI
(PBI) report, navigate to Issues > Performance Issues.
Duplicated BACnet IDs If more than one controller on the entire network has the same BACnet ID, the controller is included
in the duplicate BACnet ID list. Controllers with duplicate BACnet IDs may cause communication
problems when non-Metasys devices are part of the network. To view duplicate BACnet IDs in the
PBI report, navigate to Issues > Performance Issues.
Alarm/Events
Identifies controllers and points with alarms in the Metasys system and groups them based on alarm
priority.
Investigate and acknowledge alarms because they could be an indication of equipment issues or
other underlying root causes that need to be addressed. Alternatively, it could mean that alarm
thresholds need to be adjusted to produce fewer alarms, so that operators can focus on alarms that
are true indicators of problems.
The performance report shows alarms that are not considered urgent.
Operator Overriding
Lists objects that are currently in an operator override state. Investigate and release the override if it
is no longer needed to allow Metasys to automate control of that object.
Beginning with Metasys 7.0, the Temporary Operator Override feature was added to prevent objects
from remaining in an override state for a long time.

Type of analysis Description
AHU DA-T Variation from
Setpoint
Analyzes the Discharge Air Temperature object value for a trended period of 24 hours, and then
calculates an average deviation from setpoint for each Air Handling Unit (AHU). If the calculated
average deviation from setpoint is greater than the user-specified deviation limit, the equipment rule
generates a notification.
Absolute value of Discharge Air Temp minus the Discharge Air Temp Setpoint is greater than the
value set in the preferences.
AHU-DAP-SP Variation
from Setpoint
Analyzes the Duct Static Pressure object value for a trended period of 24 hours, and then calculates
an average deviation from the setpoint for each Air Handling Unit (AHU). If the calculated average
deviation from the setpoint is greater than user specified deviation limit, the equipment rule
generates a notification.
Absolute value of Discharge Air Pressure minus the Discharge Air Pressure Setpoint is greater than
the value set in the preferences.
AHU CO2 Variation from
Setpoint
Analyzes the CO2 sensor object value for a trended period of 24 hours, and then calculates an
average deviation from the setpoint for each Air Handling Unit (AHU). If the calculated average
deviation from the setpoint is greater than user specified deviation limit, the equipment rule
generates a notification.
Average CO2 minus the CO2 setpoint is greater than the value in the preferences.
Zone Humidity Level

PVT Sync Service
The PVT Sync Service installs with PVT and runs in the background to sync your PVT data to the cloud. The service can run in
Autoscan mode or Interactive mode. The service requires an active internet connection and only performs the synchronization after
you close PVT. After you launch PVT for the first time, you must enter your Single Sign On (SSO) credentials. Sync options remain
unavailable until you log on.
After logging on, a new column, Sync Status, appears in Open Project.
If a project is not synced, the status reads Ready to Sync.
If a project is synced, the status reads Synced.
In the Recent Project list, the cloud icon in each synced project turns green.
If you have set working hours, all projects with Ready to Sync are synced outside of these hours. To manually sync projects, click
Sync now in the Open Project dialog box. Click Sync now to override the set working hours and sync all projects with Ready to Sync
status.
If all projects are synced, the Sync now button is disabled.
Only the data from the last 7 days can display.
For autoscan mode, the sync is triggered by the scheduled scan time. When the scan completes, the scan is sent to the cloud
immediately. The cloud may take some time to process the scan so it does not show up immediately.
